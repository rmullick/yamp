			Yate Another MediaProxy (YAMP)
		    =====================================

Yate Another MediaProxy, YAMP for short, is RTPproxy alike software intend to
work with Kamailio (or any other flavour OpenSER available, wasn't tested with
any other OpenSEr flavours except Kamailio, atm). To fully make it working a
module in Kamailio is needed (currently it's named as gplexrtp). gplexrtp
communicates with YAMP via network stack, Local Communication isn't available
at the moment.

YAMP uses single port for proxying rtp media. Currently, it only try to check
whether it's a real rtp media or not. Part of it's working depends on the gplexrtp
module.

To compile simply execute "make". To compile properly it'd require libpthread,
make sure it's installed. To run:

	./yamp -s startport -e endport

by using "-s" and "-e" option, a portrange is defined. For ex, if you want to
use port 30000-35000, then do: "./yamp -s 30000 -e 35000".

NOTE: these port ranges will be opened up as yamp starts and won't be able to
use for any other purpose.

TODO: 1) Make it a deamon; 2) Implement various logging option instead of printf.
